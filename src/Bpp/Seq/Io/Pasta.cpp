      While dealing with all the formatting, names, etc., including
      strictNames and extended formats will all be the same as with
      the Fasta format, this is where it will be radically different :
      the handling of the sequence content

      For the moment, I'm keeping it simple : assuming that all of the
      'sequence' has a 'width' of 1, i.e., one can read it line by
      line, like we do below, that is, that it pertains to a binary
      alphabet (and moreover, the probability that the character is
      1).  However, one can make this much more general -- for general
      alphabets, where the 'width' would be the size S of the
      alphabet, i.e., we would read in S lines at a time -- something
      I may come back and do someday

      Note also, that the goal here is to feed this 'sequence' into a
      ProbabilisticSequence object, which contains a DataTable, where
      the intension was to read column-wise 'sequences' with
      DataTable's read function, yet I'm now feeding this row-wise
      sequence into (a column of the DataTable of)
      ProbabilisticSequence.  This is because I like the Pasta format
      as is, but in the future, another generalization could be to
      really have this column-wise type of Pasta format ... we'll
      cross that river when we get to it I suppose

      idea : a format that generalizes this one is
      p(0);p(1);p(2);...;p(s-1) where p(i) is the probability that
      site has state i, and s is the number of states (p(s) is not
      needed, because p(s) = 1 - (p(0)+...+p(s-1)) which is checked
      for in probabilistic symbol list.  Since binary alphabet has 2
      states, the format we handle here is exactly this ... something
      to think about for the future
